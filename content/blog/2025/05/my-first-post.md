# Welcome to My Blog

This is going to be my thoughts on anything and everything. It's mainly a way of playing with website building.

* 💻 Building websites
* 🖖🏽 Star Trek
* ✈️ Airplanes
* 🧠 Mental Health
* 📰 Politics
* 🎹 Music

I built this website using [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) with Turbo for smooth page transitions.

This post itself is written in Markdown.

## What I Used to Build This Blog

Here are some of the key ingredients that went into making this blog:

* **Ruby on Rails:** The framework powering the whole thing. I'm really impressed with how fast and easy it is to work with.
* **Markdown:** For writing all the content (like this post!). It's so simple and effective.
* **Turbo:** To create those smooth animations when you click between pages. It's a really nice touch!
* **Custom Styling:** I've added some personal touches to the design to make it my own.

## Code Example

Here's a simple Ruby example:

```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, World!"
end

hello_world
```

And some JavaScript:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello from Rails!";
console.log(greeting);
```

Thanks for reading!
